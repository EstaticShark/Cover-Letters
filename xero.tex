\begin{text}
    Dear Hiring Manager,\\
    
    It is with great enthusiasm that I express my interest for your job listing for a Software Developer at Xero. As an avid student of all things software and a well-rounded developer, I am  confident that I would be a valuable asset to the company and have much to gain by being at Xero.
    
    Your job listing mentions that you are looking for candidates who are experienced in Javascript, knowledge of static language and an in-depth understanding of asynchronous Javascript and bots. I happen to be experienced in many of these tools used for Hubdoc, due my experiences writting webscrapers, bots for Discord and working with Javascript such as websites and google extensions. I am also comfortable with Java and C/C++, having used them to write Android applications and emulators respectively.
    
    I confident that my development experience, strong conceptual education and willingness to learn will make me a valuable asset to the team working at Xero. I look forward to discussing the position and my qualifications with you in more detail. Thank you for your time and consideration.\\
    
    Sincerely,\\
    Martin Chak
